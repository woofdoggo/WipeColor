# WipeColor
A mod for changing the death wipe color in Celeste.
I decided to make this after somebody requested it in the Celeste Discord server.

This mod reimplements some of the core functionality provided by lordseanington's [ShaderHelper](https://github.com/lordseanington/ShaderHelper) for loading shaders. It also makes use of lordseanington's [ShaderCompiler](https://github.com/lordseanington/ShaderCompiler) tool for compiling the HLSL, as well as some of the code from their [example shaders.](https://github.com/lordseanington/ShaderHelper/blob/main/TestEffect2.fx)
